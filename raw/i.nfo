# ArcadianMaggie

FORMAT: see headers

"Pub/Pub Sub/Priv":
public             => restricted == OPEN, messageVis == ALL
public subscribers => restricted == OPEN, messageVis != ALL
private            => restricted == RESTRICTED
not really reliable, probably fastest just to automate messageVis lookup for all groups in list.

METHODOLOGY:
manual (big group effort). keyword searches, old recommendation lists, word-of-mouth, etc

# asdf

FORMAT:
< asdf> ok so the first number is 0: RESTRICTED and 1: OPEN, the second number is 0: SUBSCRIBERS, 1: ALL, 2: MODERATORS, 3: NOBODY
< asdf> after the user count

there should be a dated_groups.txt but i don't have it--301'd from transfer site, tapedrive/betamax should have a copy
<@tapedrive> Thanks asdf. Just so I get it right, the columns are members, name, last activity?
< asdf> yeah

METHODOLOGY:
<@markedL> how did asdf make your list?
< asdf> I did that for up to 3 letters but then downloaded some dictionaries in different languages and searched for all the words

# PurpleSym

FORMAT:
<@PurpleSym> It has: ["adult","desc","flagBits","groupId","groupUrl","intlCode","lastPosted","members","messageVis","name","nameWithHighlightedText","order","restricted","title"]

-info is from a few years ago, -search is recent

METHODOLOGY:
<@PurpleSym> [...] For the discovery Iâ€™m basically brute-forcing the group search to get more than 500 results.
<@PurpleSym> [...] Whenever search returns more than 500 results I add a letter to the search term and add it to the queue.

# savegroups

FORMAT:
columns: timestamp, url

METHODOLOGY:
manual (google form at tinyurl.com/savegroups).

different scrapes in the same language have ~99% overlap

METHODOLOGY:
